You are to write a program that reads this file and stores its information in a 
binary tree. The tree should be ordered on the person's last name; when two people
have the same last name, order on their first names.

Once your program has constructed the tree, it should enter an interactive loop,
taking commands from the user:

FIND firstname lastname
   - display all information about the named person,
     your program must not crash if no such person exists!

ZIP zipcode
   - display the names of all people living in the given zip code

ALL lastname
   - display all information about all people who have the given last name.

HASDOG firstname lastname
   - Note that the named person owns a dog.
     This information should be included whenever the person's info is displayed.

OLDEST
   - print the name and zipcode of the oldest person in the database.

EXIT
   - exit, no need to save changes to the database.
